<h2 id="meet-streamingi2v"> ðŸ”¥ Meet StreamingSVD - A StreamingT2V Method   </h2>

StreamingSVD is an advanced autoregressive technique for text-to-video and image-to-video generation, generating long hiqh-quality videos with rich motion dynamics, turning [SVD](https://stability.ai/research/stable-video-diffusion-scaling-latent-video-diffusion-models-to-large-datasets) into a long video generator. Our method ensures temporal consistency throughout the video, aligns closely to the input text/image, and maintains high frame-level image quality. Our demonstrations include successful examples of videos up to 200 frames, spanning 8 seconds, and can be extended for even longer durations. 

The effectiveness of the underlying autoregressive approach is not limited to the specific base model used, indicating that improvements in base models can yield even higher-quality videos. StreamingSVD is part of the [StreamingT2V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14773) family. Another successful implementation is [StreamingModelscope](https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/StreamingT2V/tree/StreamingModelscope), which is turning [Modelscope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06571) into a long-video generator. This approach enables to generate videos of up to 2 minutes length, featuring high motion amount and no stagnation.



<h2 id="news">ðŸ“° NEWS</h2>
* [08/30/2024] Code and model released!

Detailed results can be found in the [Project page](https://streamingt2v.github.io/).

## Requirements

Our code needs 60 GB of VRAM in the default setting (when generating 200 frames). Try to reduce the number of frames or activate randomized blending to reduce the memory footprint. 
Our code was tested on linux, using Python 3.9 and CUDA 11.7. 

<h2 id="Setup">ðŸ”§ Setup</h2>

1. Clone this repository and install requirements using CUDA >= 11.7: 
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/StreamingT2V.git
cd StreamingT2V/
virtualenv -p python3.9 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make sure [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org) is installed.

## Image-To-Video
To run the entire pipeline consisting of image-to-video, video enhancement (including our randomized blending) and video-frame interpolation do from the `StreamingT2V` folder:
``` shell
cd code
python inference_i2v.py --input $INPUT --output $OUTPUT
```
`$INPUT` must be the path to an image file or a folder containing images. Each image is expected to have the aspect ratio 16:9. 

`$OUTPUT` must be the path to a folder where the results will be stored.


### Adjust Hyperparameters

* number of generated frames 

Add `--num_frames $FRAMES` to the call to define the number of frames to be generated. Default value: `$FRAMES=200`

* use randomized blending

Add `--use_randomized_blending $RB` to the call to define whether to use randomized blending. Default value: `$RB=False`. When using randomized blending, the recommended values for `chunk_size` and `overlap_size` parameters are `--chunk_size 38` and `--overlap_size 12`, respectively. Please be aware that randomized blending will slow down the generation process, so try to avoid it if you have enough GPU memory.

* output FPS

Add `--out_fps $FPS` to the call to define the FPS of the output video. Default value: `$FPS=24`


## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans   
* Technical report describing StreamingSVD. 
* Release of StreamingSVD for text-to-video.  
* VRAM memory reduction. 

## MAWE (Motion Aware Warp Error)
